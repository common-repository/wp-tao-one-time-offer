Set any page as One Time Offer and show your special promotion only once per user! Works even when cookie is disabled or cleared!

== Description ==
The WP Tao OTO is plugin with gives you ability to set any page as One Time Offer. Thanks to that you can create high convertalbe "buy now or never" promotional offers (e.g. after customer buy something else or after subscribe to your newsletter) and increase your sells.

The plugin works even if user have cookies disabled, nay even on different computers if user is known! We can use so advanced technology because the plugin uses [WP Tao](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-tao/) fingerprinting (and requires WP Tao for work).
